# BME280_Breakout

The BME280 is a popular sensor module that combines temperature, humidity, and barometric pressure measurements in a single package. For a variety of uses, including interior and outdoor navigation, weather forecasting, home automation, and personal health monitoring, it offers precise readings.

Its compact size, low power consumption, and reliable performance make it a popular choice among developers and hobbyists. It is simple to incorporate into your designs and takes up little room because to its tiny form factor and integrated header. 

It features headers with pins spaced at 0.1", making it easy to attach to a breadboard for quick and convenient prototyping.

With its 3.3V compatibility and I2C interface, you can easily incorporate it into your projects with popular platforms like ESP32, RPi Pico, Raspberry Pi, Rock Pi, and other 3.3V compatible boards. This flexibility allows you to harness the power of the BME280 Breakout alongside your preferred microcontrollers, enabling precise measurements of barometric pressure, humidity, and temperature.
